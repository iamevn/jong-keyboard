# Simple Mahjong Keypad

just messing around in OpenSCAD making a simple sandwich case, pls don't judge my bad code

intended for use with mame for playing random mahjong arcade games

uses the following layout for http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/ and http://builder.swillkb.com/ to generate plates

```
[{a:7},"A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M",{x:0.25,w:1.5},"N"],
[{y:1,fa:[1]},"START",{f:3},"COIN",{f:3},"BET",{x:0.25,f:2},"TAKE SCORE",{f:3},"BIG","DUP","SMALL",{x:0.25},"FLIP FLOP","LAST SHOT",{x:0.25},"KAN","PON","CHI",{fa:[2]},"RIICHI",{f:3},"RON"]
```
